Also in order to ward-off the evil eye, the bride is adorned by a string of black beads during the ceremony. These beads, along with the silver toe rings, symbolize that she is a married woman. After this, a kunḍa (decorated silver or terra-cotta vessel) full of water is placed in front of the couple, and a ring is put in it. The groom puts his right hand in and the bride puts her left hand in and they fish for the ring. They do this three times and whoever wins more often is supposed to be the dominant one in the marriage. This is a time of fun, because water splashes everywhere and there are chants and shouts of support for both sides. Also, the bride is made to cook (a namesake meal) on the sacred flame of the Agnihōtram, symbolizing she is now responsible for taking care of the health of her husband and family.</h2>

                    Grruhapravesam is followed by a ceremony, wherein the Mangalasūtram is united. As a customary, the Telugu speaking people unite the two Mangalasūtram (which was tied by the groom around the bride’s neck), on a common thread. This ritual is done sixteen days after the wedding. This ritual can be performed by either the groom or an elderly member of the family. A few black or golden beads are slipped between the two 'plates' of the Mangalasūtram, so that they do not clash with each other. The unison of Mangalasūtram signifies the harmony between the two families. After the ceremony is over, the bride takes a bath and wears a new sari.</h2>
