             <p align="right"><h5>Christians believe that marriage is a gift from God, one that should not be taken for granted. It is the right atmosphere to engage in sexual relations and to build a family life. Getting married in a church, in front of God, is very important. A marriage is a public declaration of love and commitment.</h5></p>

<p ><i>Dear Heavenly Father, Grant us the strength to hold fast to our vows. When we got married we promised to love, honor, and cherish each other as long as we both shall live. And so we ask that you teach us to love the way that we should, with patience and kindness, forgiveness and grace</p>
     <p><i>Image result for prayer about marriage in the bible
Therefore what God has joined together, let man not separate.” The Message: The bond of marriage brings two hearts together in ways unseen. Even when we are at our weakest, we can find strength in each other. “I hold you in my heart, for we have shared together God's blessings.”</p>
    <p ><i>Lord, I pray our commitment to You and to each other will grow stronger every day, binding together a tie that is not easily broken. Teach us to “be kind to one another, tenderhearted, forgiving one another, even as God in Christ forgave” us. (Eph. 4:32) “Let us not grow weary while doing good” to each other, “for in due season we shall reap if we do not loose heart.” (Gal 6:9)</p>

<p><i>We have come together in the presence of God to witness the joining together of this man and this woman in the bond of marriage.  The sacred relationship of marriage was established by God in creation,  and it is commanded in the Scripture to be held in honor by all people.  It is at once one of man’s greatest blessings and also one of his most awesome responsibilities. Marriage is not to be entered into lightly,  but soberly and deliberately and in reverent fear of God. [Groom] and [Bride] thank you for joining them and sharing in this very special day.  Let commit this time to the Lord in prayer. </p>
