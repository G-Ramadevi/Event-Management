                <h1>Muslim Wedding</h1>
                <p class="p">One of the major components of any religion's culture is marriage. The Muslims takes the sacred wedding ceremony very seriously, as it is believed to be one of the core responsibilities of a Muslim. It is the celebration of a new bond between two souls and their families, which would later lead to the preservation of their religion and culture as their family grows.</p>
                <p>A Muslim wedding is called a Nikah Ceremony and it typically lasts for three days. This is because of the many symbolic rituals involved in the union of the families.
